##### Capstone project, Recommendation
* I recommend launching a Marketing Campaign to attract Casual Riders in June to our Docked Bikes service on weekends specially on Sundays focusing stations (1) Streeter Sr & Grand Ave, (2) Lake Shore Dr & Monroe St and (3) Millenium Park. In June Casual RidersÂ´ bike usage is high achieving its peak in July.
