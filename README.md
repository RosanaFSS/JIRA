#### Hierarchy
JIRA is organized around a *hierarchy*.

- The highest level is what we call the **application** level.
- The next level is the **project** level which contains...
- one or more **issues**.

So ... a JIRA **application** hierarchy contains **projects**, which contains **issues**.

An **issue** is any work item related to the project.
It can represent any work that needs to be done in the project, a single work item.
