#### Hierarchy
JIRA is organized around a *hierarchy*.

- The highest level is what we call the **application** level.
- The next level is the **project** level which contains...
- one or more **issues**.

So ... a JIRA **application** hierarchy contains **projects**, which contains **issues**.

An **issue** is any work item related to the project.
It can represent any work that needs to be done in the project, a single work item.
<br />
<br />

#### Project types
It is possible to create 2️⃣ types of projects in JIRA.

- next-gen projects
<br />
<br />

#### _Business project_ templates

## Visualizing work with _boards_
#### Transition
A principle of aile pojects is to visualize work and **a board is n agile tool** used to visualize and manage work. 
Boards are a view of issues arranged by status and canging the status of an issue is called **transition**.
<br />

##### Workflow
The columns of a board are related to the steps of a **workflow** and when you select Kanban as a template the default workflow that appears is _backlog_, _selected for development_, _in progress_ and _done_. You can customize it according to the needs of your team and/ or poject.
