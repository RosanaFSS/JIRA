# JIRA


## JIRA is a software used to help manage and deliver projects.

Atlassian is the company that owns JIRA.


It is organized around a *hierarchy*.

- The highest level is what we call the **application** level.
- The next level is the **project** level which contains...
- one or more **issues**.
\
\
\
So ... a JIRA **application** hierarchy contains **projects**, which contains **issues**.
\
\
\
An **issue** is any work item related to the project. It can represent any work that needs to be done in the project, a single work item.
